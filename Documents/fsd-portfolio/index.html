            <p>
                I am a creative by nature with a focus on engaging with projects of creation.
                I've worked as a graphic designer for two years, desiging logos,
                concept art, graphics, and more. I'm an oil painter and a makeup artist,
                art has always been a large part of my life.
                Activism is a large part of my life, lifiting up those whom I can is a truly rewarding
                expirence. I've have been involved in demonstrations all over the midwest, supporting POC,
                LGBTQIA+, reproductive rights, and confronting all manner of oppression and marginalization.
                I love to crochet, anything from blankets, scarves, hats, and even spider webs,
                the latter being my current obession.
